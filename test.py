# (CNN)With the sun shining, drinks on the table and music in the air, it looks like the young men in the video, which has gone viral on Chinese social media, have picked a great day for a picnic.

# Dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts, shorts and sandals, and chatting jovially in Mandarin as they hunch over a controller and screen, it's hard to believe they could be up to anything shady -- until one of them shouts excitedly, "I got a tank!"
# But these men aren't playing a computer game. They are flying drones over a military site on a nearby Taiwan-controlled island.
# The 15-second video clip is among a number of videos that have popped up recently on the Chinese social media site Weibo and show what appear to be civilian-grade drones trolling Taiwan's military. The island's military later confirmed these mysterious menaces are indeed civilian drones from mainland China.
# The videos show detailed, drones'-eye footage of military installations and personnel on Taiwan's outlying Kinmen islands. Accompanied by soundtracks ranging from ballads to dance music and plenty of emojis, the clips seem designed to highlight the unpreparedness of Taiwan's troops.
